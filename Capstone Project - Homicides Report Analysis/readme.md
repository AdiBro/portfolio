__Data Science Capstone Project - Homicides Report Analysis__  
This is the repo for my capstone project - analyzing the homicides report data. In this project I examined the data - explored trends in the data (solved vs. unsolved cases), relationships between variables, and added visual representation of the data throughout the analysis. Then I tried to predict whether a case would be solved or not based on its features.

The Data:  
The Murder Accountability Project is the most complete database of homicides in the United States currently available. This dataset includes murders from the FBI's Supplementary Homicide Report from 1976 to the present and Freedom of Information Act data on more than 22,000 homicides that were not reported to the Justice Department. This dataset includes the age, race, sex, ethnicity of victims and perpetrators, in addition to the relationship between the victim and perpetrator and weapon used.

The data was compiled and made available by the [Murder Accountability Project](http://www.murderdata.org/), founded by Thomas Hargrove. I did not include the data file due to GitHub file size limit, but it can be obtained through the Murder Accountability Project website.

Future Analysis and Research:  
I plan to keep working on this project in the future. Here are some of my ideas:
* Further analysis of population and demographic characteristics of states
* Examine police funding, staffing and relationship to clearance rate
* Look at capital punishment states vs. non-capital punishment states
* Try and identify patterns in the data - maybe I’ll find serial killers??? :)
